1.
Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages:
----------------------------------------------------

Compiled Languages:
---------------------
This languages are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute result in more
faster and more efficient code. Need to be compilated every time when a change is needed.

Interpreted Languages:
------------------------
This languages needs to be intepreted by a program to read and execute the code, is more slower than
compiled languages but is cross-platform, easier to debug, and test.

2.
Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both?
---------------------------------------------

A java program is first compiled into bytecode which JRE can understand. ByteCode is then interpreted
by the JVM making it as interpreted language, so yes, Java is both, compiled and interpreted language.


3.

Num <-- GET
ExchangeRate <-- 1 US$ = 0,0000220734 XBT
